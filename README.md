## Overview

This repository represents my **academic and technical portfolio**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/pushkar17045-afk/fundamentals-practice?style=flat-square" />
</p>

My work focuses on understanding **programming fundamentals, system logic,
and electronics-based analysis** through structured exploration and
incremental implementation.

This space is intentionally designed to reflect *how I think and learn*,
not to exaggerate finished expertise.

## Selected Work

### Fundamentals Practice
A focused programming exploration aimed at strengthening core logic,
correctness, and clarity through small, well-defined problems.

## Learning Approach

I prioritize **conceptual clarity over rapid accumulation of tools**.

My approach involves breaking systems into components, understanding their
individual roles, and integrating them into a coherent workflow.
This portfolio reflects an evolving academic learning process.
