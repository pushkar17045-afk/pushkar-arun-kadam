## Overview
This repository serves as my academic portfolio.

I am an undergraduate student exploring the intersection of programming,
system logic, and electronics-based analysis. My learning is shaped through
coursework, hands-on experiments, and structured exploration.

This portfolio reflects how I approach systems — with emphasis on
fundamentals, clarity, and incremental understanding.

## Selected Work

### IoT Data Visualization with ThingSpeak
Implemented a basic data monitoring flow to visualize sensor data on a cloud
platform. The focus was on understanding data transmission, channel
configuration, and real-time representation.

---

### Database-Backed Web Application
Developed a small web application to understand backend workflows, database
interaction, and frontend-backend integration using a local server environment.

---

### Electronic Circuit Simulation
Explored circuit behavior through simulation-based analysis, observing voltage,
current, and parameter variations using electronic simulation tools.

---

### Programming Practice & Logic Building
A collection of structured programming exercises focused on strengthening
fundamentals, logic design, and debugging across multiple languages.

---

## Learning Approach
I value conceptual clarity over rapid accumulation of tools. My approach
involves breaking systems into components, understanding their role, and
integrating them into a coherent workflow.

This portfolio is intentionally evolutionary and reflects my current stage of
learning.
